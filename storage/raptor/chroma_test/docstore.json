He had a round pink face and a pink scalp that showed through thin blond hair, and blue eyes. He wouldn't take his eyes off me. The .44 in his lap looked too big for him.\r\n\r\nI couldn't move my head, or grimace with the pain in my arms, or open my eyes more than a slit. He thought I was still out cold. I wanted to keep it that way. I needed time to figure this out. The guard bothered me. He was too soft to be just muscle, and too patient. He didn't smoke, he didn't walk around, he didn't twitch. He just watched me.\r\n\r\nMy feet swung six inches above the dirt floor. I seemed to. be hanging by my wrists. The walls were rough stone. Behind the seated man was a big wooden door with an iron bar across it. The air was cool and damp, with an underground feel. No windows.\r\n\r\nI must have twitched. He smiled and spoke in a voice I knew. \"Awake, Mr. Stone? Your skull must have incredible tensile strength. I suppose that's natural enough in your profession. You all seem to have that trait.\"\r\n\r\nHis voice was too big for him, like the gun. A resonant, commanding voice. I'd heard it once on the telephone. The Lynx: the faceless mastermind of an international criminal organization centered in Phoenix, Arizona. The Lynx had gotten me first.\r\n\r\nI looked up. It wasn't good. There were manacles welded around, my wrists. Steel chains linked them to bolt plates in the stone ceiling.\r\n\r\n\"Moose hit you with a crowbar,\" the Lynx said. \"I thought he'd crushed your skull. . . . Well, it won't help you. You've impinged on my activities once too often.\"\r\n\r\n\"Three times so far.\" Keep him talking, play for time. I wondered if he'd shoot. He didn't look like he'd ever fired a gun. Maybe he hadn't . . . himself.\r\n\r\nHe said, \"Four times. In the Case of the Whistling Rapist. The girl was one of my most valuable people, until you altered her loyalty. She would have told you far too much.\"\r\n\r\n\"You killed Lila? You little snake!\"\r\n\r\nHe frowned and raised the gun, two-handed.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't mean it, \"I said quickly. \"I lost my temper.\"\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't matter. You've seen my face.\"\r\n\r\n\"But-\"\r\n\r\n\"They call you unkillable,\" said the Lynx. \"Mike Hammer, Sam Spade, Mike Shane, Lew Archer, Shell Scott, you're all supposed\r\n\r\nto be unkillable.\" He considered me across the 'gunsight. \"You, Stone. You've challenged the Mafia, the Syndicate, the Cosa Nostra, the Rosicrucians, even the Scientologists. Always you escape. I wonder...The gun steadied.\r\n\r\n\"Now just a minute.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled. \"Pleading?\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't know how much Lila told me. Or how much I wrote down.\" Question me, Lynx.' Anything to buy time. Something would turn up. Something always did.\r\n\r\nHe thought it over. \"No, \"he said, and fired.\r\n\r\nHe knew guns. The slugs slammed into me in steady rhythm: heart, chest, chest, abdomen. I tried to scream with the flowering agony, and couldn't. The impacts swung me back against the stone wall.\r\n\r\nThe agony faded. I said, \"Damn! Now you've done it.\" The pink man's eyes went wide and round. \"Why, they're healing!\" He paced a careful circle around me, watching the wounds pucker and fade. \"You are unkillable!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nah. It's just that some of us heal fast.\"\r\n\r\nHe walked backward until the wall stopped him. His voice came out shockingly normal, considering he was still trying to back through the wall. \"Very interesting, Stone. But why were you afraid of being shot? If you can't be killed, or even hurt-\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it's a secret.\" I broke the chains and came for him. He used his bullets, then tried to climb the stone wall. He didn't make it.\r\n\r\nThe End", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3895, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "67defb34-eb61-4264-8117-d543ee287c7a": {"__data__": {"id_": "67defb34-eb61-4264-8117-d543ee287c7a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Rob\\GitHub\\robertscotthoward\\python\\pylib\\data\\corpus1\\Niven, Larry - Unfinished Story.doc.cleaned", "file_name": "Niven, Larry - Unfinished Story.doc.cleaned", "file_size": 1161, "creation_date": "2026-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2026-01-29", "parent_id": "d713f8ea-59d2-4691-84d7-f66a3988c2ab"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date", "parent_id"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date", "parent_id"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b19a1d92-9d0b-4acc-9497-8ad6d6710e6e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Rob\\GitHub\\robertscotthoward\\python\\pylib\\data\\corpus1\\Niven, Larry - Unfinished Story.doc.cleaned", "file_name": "Niven, Larry - Unfinished Story.doc.cleaned", "file_size": 1161, "creation_date": "2026-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2026-01-29"}, "hash": "4a9614cf40929a0dc768e8fb2b27db6395446f31a19f8f1a0833094d604186ac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Unfinished Story\r\nby Larry Niven\r\n========================\r\n\r\nUNFINISHED STORY # 1\r\n\r\nAs he left the blazing summer heat outside the Warlock's cave, the visiting sorcerer sighed with pleasure. \"Warlock, how can you keep the place so cool?

The hunched human ushered the barrel-shaped being into his office. \"What can I do for\r\nyou?\"\r\n\"Doctor, doctor, I is terrible problem.\" The words were thick, but, to its credit, the Kogloo was working\r\nwithout a translator. \"I try to writing Skience Fiction, no?\"\r\n\"So?\"\r\n\"So this!\" The Kogloo upended a satchel over Butcher's already cluttered desk. Countless cards and\r\npieces of paper cascaded out.\r\n\"Rejection slips?\" Butcher grunted. He had his own collection from The Lancet. \"Unless you've got\r\nwriter's cramp, I can't help you.\"\r\n\"No, please.\" The alien's tripartite mandible popped the P. \"I write good, in mine own language, no?\"\r\nButcher had heard that the big four SF chips had Kogloonian editions now. \"I send novella to Amazing --\r\nthe love it! They even buy! Effing SF is eating out of my foot. Analog, the same.
