his mortality.

too scarce a good thing; the more’s the pity. So, if any one man,

has anything bountifully laughable about him, be sure there is

If I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so
outlandish an individual as Queequeg circulating among the
polite society of a civilized town, that astonishment soon de-

of New Bedford.
In thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport
will frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts
from foreign parts. Even in Broadway and Chestnut streets,
Mediterranean mariners will sometimes jostle the affrighted
ladies. Regent Street is not unknown to Lascars and Malays;
and at Bombay, in the Apollo Green, live Yankees have often
scared the natives. But New Bedford beats all Water Street

I was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the
infallible Presbyterian Church. How then could I unite with
this wild idolator in worshipping his piece of wood? But what
is worship? thought I. Do you suppose now, Ishmael, that the
magnanimous God of heaven and earth—pagans and all in-
cluded—can possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of black
wood? Impossible! But what is worship?—to do the will of
God—that is worship. And what is the will of God?—to do to
my fellow man what I would have my fellow man to do to
me—that is the will of God. Now, Queequeg is my fellow man.
And what do I wish that this Queequeg would do to me? Why,

Consequently, I must then unite with him in his; ergo, I must
turn idolator. So I kindled the shavings; helped prop up the

had seen a sailor who had visited that very island, and he told
me that it was the custom, when a great battle had been gained
there, to barbecue all the slain in the yard or garden of the
victor; and then, one by one, they were placed in great wooden
trenchers, and garnished round like a pilau, with breadfruit
and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in their mouths, were
sent round with the victor’s compliments to all his friends, just

I was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah
was really dogging us or not, and with that intent crossed the
way with Queequeg, and on that side of it retraced our steps.
But Elijah passed on, without seeming to notice us. This re-

All Astir.
A day or two passed, and there was great activity aboard
the Pequod. Not only were the old sails being mended, but
new sails were coming on board, and bolts of canvas, and coils
of rigging; in short, everything betokened that the ship’s prepa-
rations were hurrying to a close. Captain Peleg seldom or never
went ashore, but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp look-out
upon the hands: Bildad did all the purchasing and providing
at the stores; and the men employed in the hold and on the
rigging were working till long after night-fall.
On the day following Queequeg’s signing the articles, word
was given at all the inns where the ship’s company were stop-
ping, that their chests must be on board before night, for there
was no telling how soon the vessel might be sailing. So

a high hand on the quarter-deck, just as if they were to be

It is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens,
even modern ones, a certain curious process of seasoning them
for their functions is gone through. There is a saltcellar of state,
so called, and there may be a castor of state. How they use the
salt, precisely—who knows? Certain I am, however, that a king’s
head is solemnly oiled at his coronation, even as a head of
salad. Can it be, though, that they anoint it with a view of
making its interior run well, as they anoint machinery? Much

might be ruminated here, concerning the essential dignity of
this regal process, because in common life we esteem but meanly
and contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair, and palpably
smells of that anointing. In truth, a mature man who uses hair-
oil, unless medicinally, that man has probably got a quoggy
spot in him somewhere. As a general rule, he can’t amount to
much in his totality.
But the only thing to be considered here, is this—what kind
of oil is used at coronations? Certainly it cannot be olive oil,

nor macassar oil, nor castor oil, nor bear’s oil, nor train oil, nor
cod-liver oil. What then can it possibly be, but sperm oil in its

Think of that, ye loyal Britons! we whalemen supply your
kings and queens with coronation stuff! The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of
Nantucket, and a Quaker by descent. He was a long, earnest
man, and though born on an icy coast, seemed well adapted to
endure hot latitudes, his flesh being hard as twice-baked bis-
cuit. Transported to the Indies, his live blood would not spoil
like bottled ale. He must have been born in some time of gen-
eral drought and famine, or upon one of those fast days for
which his state is famous. Only some thirty arid summers had
he seen; those summers had dried up all his physical superflu-
ousness. But this, his thinness, so to speak, seemed no more
the token of wasting anxieties and cares, than it seemed the
indication of any bodily blight. It was merely the condensa-

The Specksynder.
Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as
good a place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on
ship-board, arising from the existence of the harpooneer class
of officers, a class unknown of course in any other marine than
the whale-fleet.
The large importance attached to the harpooneer’s voca-
tion is evinced by the fact, that originally in the old Dutch
Fishery, two centuries and more ago, the command of a whale
ship was not wholly lodged in the person now called the cap-
tain, but was divided between him and an officer called the
Specksynder. Literally this word means Fat-Cutter; usage,
however, in time made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer. In
those days, the captain’s authority was restricted to the naviga-

without the aid of some sort of external arts and entrench-

it is, that for ever keeps God’s true princes of the Empire from
the world’s hustings; and leaves the highest honours that this
air can give, to those men who become famous more through
their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of the
Divine Inert, than through their undoubted superiority over
the dead level of the mass. Such large virtue lurks in these
small things when extreme political superstitions invest them,
that in some royal instances even to idiot imbecility they have
imparted potency. But when, as in the case of Nicholas the
Czar, the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles an
imperial brain; then, the plebeian herds crouch abased before
the tremendous centralization. Nor, will the tragic dramatist
who would depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep
and direct swing, ever forget a hint, incidentally so important

have lived out of the cabin than in it. For when they did enter
it, it was something as a street-door enters a house; turning
inwards for a moment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a
permanent thing, residing in the open air. Nor did they lose

In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned
almost simultaneously with the vessel’s leaving her port; even
though she may have fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail
ere reaching her proper cruising ground. And if, after a three,
four, or five years’ voyage she is drawing nigh home with any-
thing empty in her—say, an empty vial even—then, her mast-
heads are kept manned to the last; and not till her skysail-
poles sail in among the spires of the port, does she altogether
relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more.
Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or
afloat, is a very ancient and interesting one, let us in some

Hark!
“HIST! Did you hear that noise, Cabaco?
It was the middle-watch; a fair moonlight; the seamen were
standing in a cordon, extending from one of the fresh-water
butts in the waist, to the scuttle-butt near the taffrail. In this
manner, they passed the buckets to fill the scuttle-butt. Stand-
ing, for the most part, on the hallowed precincts of the quar-
ter-deck, they were careful not to speak or rustle their feet.
From hand to hand, the buckets went in the deepest silence,
only broken by the occasional flap of a sail, and the steady
hum of the unceasingly advancing keel.
It was in the midst of this repose, that Archy, one of the
cordon, whose post was near the after-hatches, whispered to
his neighbor, a Cholo, the words above.

There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange

for a vast practical joke, though the wit thereof he but dimly
discerns, and more than suspects that the joke is at nobody’s
expense but his own. However, nothing dispirits, and nothing
seems worth while disputing. He bolts down all events, all
creeds, and beliefs, and persuasions, all hard things visible and
invisible, never mind how knobby; as an ostrich of potent di-
gestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints. And as for small
difficulties and worryings, prospects of sudden disaster, peril
of life and limb; all these, and death itself, seem to him only
sly, good-natured hits, and jolly punches in the side bestowed

the Goney (Albatross) by name. As she slowly drew nigh, from
my lofty perch at the fore-mast-head, I had a good view of
that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean fisheries—a
whaler at sea, and long absent from home.
As if the waves had been fullers, this craft was bleached
like the skeleton of a stranded walrus. All down her sides, this
spectral appearance was traced with long channels of reddened
rust, while all her spars and her rigging were like the thick
branches of trees furred over with hoar-frost. Only her lower
sails were set. A wild sight it was to see her long-bearded look-
outs at those three mast-heads. They seemed clad in the skins

The ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the
whaler we had spoken was this: the wind and sea betokened
storms. But even had this not been the case, he would not after
all, perhaps, have boarded her—judging by his subsequent con-
duct on similar occasions—if so it had been that, by the pro-
cess of hailing, he had obtained a negative answer to the ques-
tion he put. For, as it eventually turned out, he cared not to
consort, even for five minutes, with any stranger captain, ex-
cept he could contribute some of that information he so ab-

Stubb’s whale had been killed some distance from the ship.
It was a calm; so, forming a tandem of three boats, we com-
menced the slow business of towing the trophy to the Pequod.
And now, as we eighteen men with our thirty-six arms, and
one hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers, slowly toiled hour

seemed hardly to budge at all, except at long intervals; good
evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass
we moved. For, upon the great canal of Hang-Ho, or whatever
they call it, in China, four or five laborers on the foot-path will
draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour; but

The Right Whale’s Head—Contrasted View.
Crossing the deck, let us now have a good long look at the
Right Whale’s head.
As in general shape the noble Sperm Whale’s head may be
compared to a Roman war-chariot (especially in front, where
it is so broadly rounded); so, at a broad view, the Right Whale’s
head bears a rather inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot-
toed shoe. Two hundred years ago an old Dutch voyager lik-
ened its shape to that of a shoemaker’s last. And in this same
last or shoe, that old woman of the nursery tale, with the swarm-
ing brood, might very comfortably be lodged, she and all her
progeny.
But as you come nearer to this great head it begins to as-
sume different aspects, according to your point of view. If you

the Leviathan (the Right Whale, and the varieties of that or-
der), concerning which the fishermen have this saying, “A penny
roll would choke him”; his swallow is so very small. But, to
this, Bishop Jebb’s anticipative answer is ready. It is not neces-
sary, hints the Bishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in
the whale’s belly, but as temporarily lodged in some part of his
mouth. And this seems reasonable enough in the good Bishop.
For truly, the Right Whale’s mouth would accommodate a
couple of whist-tables, and comfortably seat all the players.

Possibly, too, Jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow

*Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between
the whale and the elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in
that particular the elephant stands in much the same respect

is the spout. It is well known that the elephant will often draw

Now, though such great bodies are at times encountered,
yet, as must have been seen, even at the present day, small de-

to fifty individuals each. Such bands are known as schools.
They generally are of two sorts; those composed almost en-

To any meditative Magian rover, this serene Pacific, once
beheld, must ever after be the sea of his adoption. It rolls the
midmost waters of the world, the Indian ocean and Atlantic
being but its arms. The same waves wash the moles of the
new-built Californian towns, but yesterday planted by the
recentest race of men, and lave the faded but still gorgeous
skirts of Asiatic lands, older than Abraham; while all between
float milky-ways of coral isles, and low-lying, endless, unknown
Archipelagoes, and impenetrable Japans. Thus this mysteri-
ous, divine Pacific zones the world’s whole bulk about; makes
all coasts one bay to it; seems the tide-beating heart of earth.

The Forge.
With matted beard, and swathed in a bristling shark-skin
apron, about mid-day, Perth was standing between his forge
and anvil, the latter placed upon an iron-wood log, with one
hand holding a pike-head in the coals, and with the other at
his forge’s lungs, when Captain Ahab came along, carrying in
his hand a small rusty-looking leathern bag. While yet a little
distance from the forge, moody Ahab paused; till at last, Perth,
withdrawing his iron from the fire, began hammering it upon
the anvil—the red mass sending off the sparks in thick hover-
ing flights, some of which flew close to Ahab.

Penetrating further and further into the heart of the Japa-

the boats, steadily pulling, or sailing, or paddling after the
whales, or for an interlude of sixty or seventy minutes calmly
awaiting their uprising; though with but small success for their
pains.

The four whales slain that evening had died wide apart;
one, far to windward; one, less distant, to leeward; one ahead;
one astern. These last three were brought alongside ere night-
fall; but the windward one could not be reached till morning;
and the boat that had killed it lay by its side all night; and that
boat was Ahab’s.
The waif-pole was thrust upright into the dead whale’s
spout-hole; and the lantern hanging from its top, cast a troubled
flickering glare upon the black, glossy back, and far out upon
the midnight waves, which gently chafed the whale’s broad
flank, like soft surf upon a beach.
Ahab and all his boat’s crew seemed asleep but the Parsee;

The Log and Line.
While now the fated Pequod had been so long afloat this
voyage, the log and line had but very seldom been in use. Owing
to a confident reliance upon other means of determining the
vessel’s place, some merchantmen, and many whalemen, espe-
cially when cruising, wholly neglect to heave the log; though
at the same time, and frequently more for form’s sake than
anything else, regularly putting down upon the customary slate
the course steered by the ship, as well as the presumed average
rate of progression every hour. It had been thus with the
Pequod. The wooden reel and angular log attached hung, long
untouched, just beneath the railing of the after bulwarks. Rains
and spray had damped it; sun and wind had warped it; all the
elements had combined to rot a thing that hung so idly. But

It was a clear steel-blue day. The firmaments of air and sea
were hardly separable in that all-pervading azure; only, the
pensive air was transparently pure and soft, with a woman’s
look, and the robust and man-like sea heaved with long, strong,
lingering swells, as Samson’s chest in his sleep.
Hither, and thither, on high, glided the snow-white wings
of small, unspeckled birds; these were the gentle thoughts of
the feminine air; but to and fro in the deeps, far down in the
bottomless blue, rushed mighty leviathans, sword-fish, and
sharks; and these were the strong, troubled, murderous
thinkings of the masculine sea.
