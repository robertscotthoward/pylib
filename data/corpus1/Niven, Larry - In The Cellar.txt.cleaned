in the cellar by larry niven mr niven tells us that he never can predict when the urge will strike to turn out one of these little pieces when it does and he does we re always happy to use them the man in the folding chair was the only one in the room as far as i could tell without moving my head he had a round pink face and a pink scalp that showed through thin blond hair and blue eyes he wouldn t take his eyes off me the 44 in his lap looked too big for him i couldn t move my head or grimace with the pain in my arms or open my eyes more than a slit he thought i was still out cold i wanted to keep it that way i needed time to figure this out the guard bothered me he was too soft to be just muscle and too patient he didn t smoke he didn t walk around he didn t twitch he just watched me my feet swung six inches above the dirt floor i seemed to be hanging by my wrists the walls were rough stone behind the seated man was a big wooden door with an iron bar across it the air was cool and damp with an underground feel no windows i must have twitched he smiled and spoke in a voice i knew awake mr stone your skull must have incredible tensile strength i suppose that s natural enough in your profession you all seem to have that trait his voice was too big for him like the gun a resonant commanding voice i d heard it once on the telephone the lynx the faceless mastermind of an international criminal organization centered in phoenix arizona the lynx had gotten me first i looked up it wasn t good there were manacles welded around my wrists steel chains linked them to bolt plates in the stone ceiling moose hit you with a crowbar the lynx said i thought he d crushed your skull well it won t help you you ve impinged on my activities once too often three times so far keep him talking play for time i wondered if he d shoot he didn t look like he d ever fired a gun maybe he hadn t himself he said four times in the case of the whistling rapist the girl was one of my most valuable people until you altered her loyalty she would have told you far too much you killed lila you little snake he frowned and raised the gun two handed i didn t mean it i said quickly i lost my temper it doesn t matter you ve seen my face but they call you unkillable said the lynx mike hammer sam spade mike shane lew archer shell scott you re all supposed to be unkillable he considered me across the gunsight you stone you ve challenged the mafia the syndicate the cosa nostra the rosicrucians even the scientologists always you escape i wonder the gun steadied now just a minute he smiled pleading you don t know how much lila told me or how much i wrote down question me lynx anything to buy time something would turn up something always did he thought it over no he said and fired he knew guns the slugs slammed into me in steady rhythm heart chest chest abdomen i tried to scream with the flowering agony and couldn t the impacts swung me back against the stone wall the agony faded i said damn now you ve done it the pink man s eyes went wide and round why they re healing he paced a careful circle around me watching the wounds pucker and fade you are unkillable nah it s just that some of us heal fast he walked backward until the wall stopped him his voice came out shockingly normal considering he was still trying to back through the wall very interesting stone but why were you afraid of being shot if you can t be killed or even hurt because it s a secret i broke the chains and came for him he used his bullets then tried to climb the stone wall he didn t make it the end
